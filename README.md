Overarch
========
A data driven description of software architecture based on the C4 model.

Describe your model as data and specify/generate representations (e.g. diagrams)
for your model. All core and supplementary C4 diagrams except code diagrams are
supported.

Overarch is not so much about how to model your architecture
(see [C4 Model](https://c4model.com) for that), but about making the models
composable and reusable.

*Disclaimer: this project is in alpha stage - the data format might change*


Rationale
---------

C4 models are great to vizualize an architecture on different levels of detail
with the various diagrams types. The value lies in an expressive description
and visualization of an architecture with different views.

But but the models used for diagram generation with the existing tools are not
models in the sense of generality. Especially if you describe your model in
PlantUML files, these descriptions are mere textfiles.

The textfiles don't compose and you can't do anything else with these
descriptions other than render them with PlantUML. The parsing process is
opaque and you don't have access to the data of the model.

Also the model is complected with the diagrams, as layout and rendering
information is part of the model description and vice versa.

If the model is described as plain *data* in an open format, it can be
transformed into a graphical representation, e.g. into PlantUML textfiles.

The model data should be separated from information about these representations.
They can be composed with these information and with other models. By doing so,
the model may also be used in other ways, e.g. the generation of documentation,
code or infrastructure.

Even if the model is specified as data, the format should be a text file (EDN,
JSON) to be easily edited with text editors by the whole team and to be committed
to version control, instead of being in some propriatory binary format.

The native format should be Extensible Data Notation (EDN) with representations
in other formats like JSON. EDN is a textual format for data, which is human
readable. It is directly readable into data structures in clojure code.

The data format should be open for extension. E.g. it should cope with additional
attributes or element types in the data structures.

The model should describe the architecture (the structure) of your system(s).
The elements are based on the C4 model and are a hierarchical composition of the
elements of the architecture.

Model references should be used to refer to model elements from representations
(e.g. diagrams). To allow references to relations, the definition of a relation
must have an id.

Model references may be enhanced with additional attributes that are specific
to the usage context (e.g. a style attribute in the context of a diagram)

Examples
--------
This is an example of the specification of a model and some diagrams based on the
Internet Banking System example of Simon Brown at [C4 Model](https://c4model.com).

The complete model and diagram specifications can be found under
[models/banking](/models/banking).

### Example of a model definition

```clojure
#{{:el :person
  :id :banking/personal-customer
  :name "Personal Banking Customer"
  :desc "A customer of the bank, with personal banking accounts."}
 {:el :system
  :id :banking/internet-banking-system
  :name "Internet Banking System"
  :desc "Allows customers to view information about their bank accounts and make payments."
  :ct #{{:el :container
         :id :banking/web-app
         :name "Web Application"
         :desc "Deliveres the static content and the internet banking single page application."
         :tech "Clojure and Luminus"}
        {:el :container
         :id :banking/single-page-app
         :name "Single-Page Application"
         :desc "Provides all of the internet banking functionality to customers via their web browser."
         :tech "ClojureScript and Re-Frame"}
        {:el :container
         :id :banking/mobile-app
         :name "Mobile App"
         :desc "Provides a limited subset of the internet banking functionality to customers via their mobile device."
         :tech "ClojureScript and Reagent"}
        {:el :container
         :id :banking/api-application
         :name "API Application"
         :desc "Provides internet banking functionality via a JSON/HTTPS API."
         :tech "Clojure and Liberator"}
        {:el :container
         :subtype :database
         :id :banking/database
         :name "Database"
         :desc "Stores the user registration information, hashed authentication credentials, access logs, etc."
         :tech "Datomic"}}}
 {:el :system
  :id :banking/mainframe-banking-system
  :external true
  :name "Mainframe Banking System"
  :desc "Stores all the core banking information about customers, accounts, transactions, etc."}
 {:el :system
  :id :banking/email-system
  :external true
  :name "E-mail System"
  :desc "The internal Microsoft Exchange email system."}

 ; Context view relations 
 {:el :rel
  :id :banking/personal-customer-uses-internet-banking-system
  :from :banking/personal-customer
  :to :banking/internet-banking-system
  :name "Views account balances and makes payments using"}
 {:el :rel
  :id :banking/internet-banking-system-uses-email-system
  :from :banking/internet-banking-system
  :to :banking/email-system
  :name "Sends e-mail using"}
 {:el :rel
  :id :banking/internet-banking-system-using-mainframe-banking-system
  :from :banking/internet-banking-system
  :to :banking/mainframe-banking-system
  :name "Gets account information from, and makes payments using"}
 {:el :rel
  :id :banking/email-system-sends-mail-to-personal-customer
  :from :banking/email-system
  :to :banking/personal-customer
  :name "Sends e-mail to"}} 
 ```

### Example of a views specification

```clojure
#{{:el :context-view
  :id :banking/system-context-view
  :spec {:legend true}
  :title "System Context View of the Internet Banking System"
  :ct [; model elements
       {:ref :banking/personal-customer}
       {:ref :banking/email-system}
       {:ref :banking/mainframe-banking-system}
       {:ref :banking/internet-banking-system}
       
       ; relations
       {:ref :banking/personal-customer-uses-internet-banking-system :direction :down}
       {:ref :banking/internet-banking-system-uses-email-system :direction :right}
       {:ref :banking/internet-banking-system-using-mainframe-banking-system}
       {:ref :banking/email-system-sends-mail-to-personal-customer :direction :up}]}

 {:el :container-view
  :id :banking/container-view
  :spec {:legend true}
  :title "Container View of the Internet Banking System"
  :ct [; model elements
       {:ref :banking/personal-customer}
       {:ref :banking/internet-banking-system}
       {:ref :banking/email-system}
       {:ref :banking/mainframe-banking-system}

       ; relations
       {:ref :banking/email-system-sends-mail-to-personal-customer :direction :up}
       {:ref :banking/personal-customer-uses-web-app}
       {:ref :banking/personal-customer-uses-single-page-app}
       {:ref :banking/personal-customer-uses-mobile-app}

       {:ref :banking/web-app-deliveres-single-page-app :direction :right}
       {:ref :banking/single-page-app-calls-api-application}
       {:ref :banking/mobile-app-calls-api-application}
       {:ref :banking/api-application-uses-database :direction :left}
       {:ref :banking/api-application-uses-email-system :direction :right}
       {:ref :banking/api-application-uses-mainframe-banking-system}
       ]}
}
 ```

Build
-----
Overarch is written in [Clojure](https://clojure.org) and build with
[leiningen](https://leiningen.org/). To build it, you need to have Java 11 or higher
and leiningen installed.

In the cloned overarch repository, run

```
lein uberjar
```

to build a JAR file with all dependencies.
See Usage on how to run it with it's CLI interface.


Usage
-----
If you have a clojure environment in some editor or IDE, just use it.
If not, try Visual Studio Code with the Calva and PlantUML extensions.
With this setup you get an editor for the EDN files with code completion,
syntax check and syntax highlighting.

![Model editing](/doc/overarch_vscode_model.png)

You also get integrated previews of the exported PlantUML diagrams and the
ability to generate image files in different formats (e.g. PNG, SVG, PDF, ...)
directly from within Visual Studio Code.

![PlantUML preview](/doc/overarch_plantuml_preview.png)

Use a folder for all the data (e.g. models, diagram specifications).
Add EDN files for the model and the diagram specifications and other representations.
All the EDN files in the folder will be loaded.

Command Line Interface

```
